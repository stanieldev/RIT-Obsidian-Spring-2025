"their description requires both general relativity and nuclear physics"
"The latter comes into play via the equation of state (EOS) of matter up to densities exceeding nuclear saturation density"

"The EOS is assumed to be universal, i.e., not dependent on the star’s origin."

"NSs are distinguished individuals with different surface temperature, magnetic field strengths and topologies, rotation rates, and propensity for glitches or radiation outbursts."

"However, they can be described by a few scalar properties well enough for many astrophysical applications."

"gravitational mass, which completely determines the metric outside the NS"

"There is also a “baryonic mass”, which expresses the baryon number in units of mass, and which is important as a conserved quantity, e.g., in the context of neutron star mergers. The difference between baryonic and gravitational mass defines the binding energy"

"The tidal deformability of a NS is the proportionality factor between external tidal fields and the induced quadrupole moment. It is very important for the late inspiral phase of BNS mergers as it determines the main corrections of the orbital dynamics compared to the binary black hole case, and thus the observable gravitational wave (GW) signal."


"The moment of inertia can also serve to constrain the EOS and might be measured, e.g., via observation of double pulsar systems [14](C. A. Raithel, F. Ozel, and D. Psaltis, Phys. Rev. C ¨ 93, 032801 (2016).)."

"Another possibility is the measurement of mass and tidal deformability using observations of gravitational waves from BNS coalescence, such as the famous event GW170817"

"If electromagnetic counterparts in a BNS multimessenger observation carry information on the fate of the remnant, it can be used to constrain the EOS."


"We assume that NS matter in GR can be described by the stress-energy tensor of a perfect fluid, given by"
$$T_{\mu\nu}=(E+P)u_\mu u_\nu + Pg_{\mu\nu}$$
