### Neutron Stars
 - Serve as natural laboratories for ultradense matter.
 - Insights of matter under extreme conditions (not achievable on Earth).
 - They are remnants of massive stellar explosions.
 - Density exceeds nuclear saturation density.
 - Internal structure and composition are an interest to astrophys and nuclear.

### Equation of State
 - Crucial for determining properties such as their mass-radius relation, maximum mass, and tidal deformability.
