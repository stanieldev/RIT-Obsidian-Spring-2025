Neutron stars serve as natural laboratories for studying ultra-dense matter, providing insights into the behavior of matter under extreme conditions that cannot be replicated on Earth. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

These objects are the remnants of massive stellar explosions and contain densities exceeding nuclear saturation density, making their internal structure and composition a subject of significant interest in astrophysics and nuclear physics. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

Understanding the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars is crucial for determining key properties such as their mass-radius relation, maximum mass, and tidal deformability, all of which have direct implications for both fundamental physics and astrophysical observations. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

Over the decades, numerous theoretical models have been proposed to describe the internal composition of neutron stars, ranging from purely hadronic descriptions to models incorporating deconfined quark matter. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

Each of these models makes different assumptions about the interactions between particles at extreme densities and provides unique predictions regarding neutron star observables. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

Recent advancements in observational techniques, including gravitational wave detections from binary neutron star mergers (e.g., GW170817) and precise X-ray timing measurements from NICER, have provided unprecedented constraints on the neutron star EoS. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

These observations, combined with theoretical developments in nuclear physics and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), have led to significant progress in understanding the microphysics governing neutron stars. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies used to construct neutron star EoS, categorizing them into different classes based on their physical assumptions and derivation techniques. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

We discuss the historical development of these models, highlight key findings, and compare their predictions with observational constraints. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)

Finally, we explore the future directions in this field, emphasizing the role of upcoming astrophysical missions and theoretical advancements in refining our understanding of neutron star interiors. [2502.05513](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05513)
