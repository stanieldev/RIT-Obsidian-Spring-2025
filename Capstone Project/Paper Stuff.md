### Abstract
Binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are an important process to study for understanding extreme astrophysical phenomena, providing insights into nuclear microphysics and general relativity through multi-messenger astronomy.




 However, high-fidelity simulations of BNSMs are computationally demanding due to the need to resolve dense nuclear matter, tidal interactions, and gravitational wave emission. In this paper, we focus on improving simulation efficiency through Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) and Dynamic Time Scaling (DTS)â€”a technique that increases time steps in regions with a lower Stress-Energy tensor to optimize performance. We also analyze benchmark profiling data from the Einstein Toolkit, identifying computational bottlenecks in BNSM simulations. To test the efficacy of AMR + DTS, we implement a Python-based simulation of an alternative physical system, avoiding the complexity of full general relativity while preserving key computational challenges. By refining numerical techniques and reducing unnecessary computational overhead, this study provides a foundation for more efficient astrophysical simulations, enabling deeper exploration of neutron star mergers and their associated signatures.
