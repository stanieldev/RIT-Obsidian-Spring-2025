## Application of Local Time-Stepping for Adaptive Mesh Refinement in Simulated Binary Neutron Star Mergers




### Introduction   (Narrative, no subsections)
Binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are among the most extreme astrophysical events, serving as experimental laboratories for determining the fundamental physics of our universe. During the process of BNSMs, these stars provide significant insight into the interplay between high-energy nuclear physics and massive relativistic effects, as well as generate powerful gravitational waves, eject neutron-rich material, and drive the synthesis of heavy elements through rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. 

Understanding BNSMs, as well as neutron stars by themselves, are essential for constraining the equation of state (EOS) of ultra-dense matter, a significant challenge to current astrophysics. The EOS assumed to be a universal condition of dense nuclear matter, independent of the origin of the stars. The accurate modeling of EOS's are especially integral for determining neutron star properties such as mass, radius, binding energy, moment of inertia, and tidal deformation. Numerous theoretical models have aimed to describe the matter within neutron stars, each predicting distinct observable signatures. e.g. Upper mass threshold, binding energy, etc. These models, then, provide precise EOS constraints as a vital aspect of neutron star physics.
