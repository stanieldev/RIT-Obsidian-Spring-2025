### Historical Solutions to EOS
 - The equations governing mass and radius of nonrotating neutron stars (NS) are known since the early work by [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.55.364), [2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.55.374). [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Not all solutions for static NS are stable against radial perturbations. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - The single parameter sequence of NS consists of one or more stable and unstable branches, which depends on the EOS [3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/148791). [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Moment of inertia were derived by [4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/149400) for slowly rotating NS.  [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Tidal deformability have been derived in [5â€“8]. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - The computation of (moment of inertia and tidal deformation) requires the solution of an ordinary differential equation system (ODE) with singular boundary conditions. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)


### Complications in EOS
 - Phase transitions in the EOS, which can lead to discontinuities in the energy density as function of pressure. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Continuous transitions don't cause issues (mostly). [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - A true discontinuity can be treated analytically for the tidal deformability ODE [9, 10].
