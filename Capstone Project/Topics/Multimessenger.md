### Multi-Messenger Astronomy
Observations of radio or gamma-ray pulsars, accreting neutron stars and x-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and recently, the gravitational waves (GW) from coalescing binary neutron stars. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

Measurements of NS properties can help to constrain the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star matter. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Any measurement of a NS mass provides a lower bound for the maximum NS mass. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Measurement of mass-radius relations by electromagnetic observations (see, e.g., [11–13]). [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346) 
 - The moment of inertia can constrain the EOS via observation of double pulsar systems [14].  [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Measurement of mass and tidal deformability using observations of gravitational waves from BNS coalescence, such as the famous event GW170817 [15– 20]. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Further, the stability of BNS merger remnant is related to the maximum NS mass. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - If electromagnetic counterparts in a BNS multi-messenger observation carry information on the fate of the remnant, it can be used to constrain the EOS. This was already done (under additional assumptions) using the short gamma ray burst associated with GW170817 [21]. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
