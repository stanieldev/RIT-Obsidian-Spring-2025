Neutron stars (NS) are among the most interesting astrophysical objects, as their description requires both general relativity and nuclear physics. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

NSs are distinguished individuals with different surface temperature, magnetic field strengths and topologies, rotation rates, and propensity for glitches or radiation outbursts. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

(For MMA) Computing NS properties for a given EOS, such as mass, radius, moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and , is therefore an important task. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

**Properties of a Neutron Star:**
 - Gravitational Mass
	 - Completely determines the metric outside the NS. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Baryonic Mass
	 - expresses the baryon number in units of mass. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - important as a conserved quantity... in neutron star mergers. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - NS mass is bounded, maximum mass depends on the EOS. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Binding Energy
	 - The difference between baryonic and gravitational mass. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Proper Circumferential Radius
	 - Expresses the NS size. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - Determines surface area. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Compactness
	 - Ratio of gravitational mass over proper circumferential radius. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - Directly determines the surface redshift. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - Strongly correlated with oscillation frequencies, moment of inertia, or tidal deformability. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Moment of Inertia
	 - Answers questions related to spin-down or glitches. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - Determines lowest order rotational corrections to metric. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Tidal Deformation
	 - Proportionality factor between external tidal fields and induced quadrupole moment. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - Important for late in-spiral phase of BNS mergers. Determines main corrections to orbital dynamics. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
	 - Corrections, compared to binary black hole mergers lead to gravitational wave signals [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346).
