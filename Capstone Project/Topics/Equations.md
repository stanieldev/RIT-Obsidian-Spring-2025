### Equations:

Stress Energy of a perfect fluid ([2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346))
$$\begin{align}
T_{\mu\nu}&=(E+P)u_\mu u_\nu + P g_{\mu\nu}
\end{align}$$
Where $u$ is the 4-velocity of the fluid, $E$ is total energy density in rest frame of the matter, and $P$ is the pressure. Approximation of isotropic pressure, and exclude any shear-stresses. This is commonly neglected in Tidal Deformation calculations.
Parameters ([2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)):
$$\begin{align}
\rho&=m_Bn_B\\
\epsilon&=\dfrac{E-\rho}{\rho}\\
h&=\dfrac{E+P}{\rho}=1+\epsilon+\dfrac{P}{\rho}
\end{align}$$


### Equation of State
(nuclear physics) comes into play via the equation of state (EOS) of matter up to densities exceeding nuclear saturation density. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
The EOS is assumed to be universal, i.e., not dependent on the star’s origin. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

Given a thermodynamic potential and its canonical state variables, one can derive all other quantities. Such derived relations are collectively referred to as equation of state (EOS). [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
#### Equation of State (Helmholtz)
We can parametrize the EOS as functions [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346):
 - $F(V,T,N_i)$ is the Helmholtz Free Energy.
 - $P(\rho, T, Y_e)=\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial V}$ : Pressure
 - $S(\rho, T, Y_e)=\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial T}$ : Entropy
 - $E(\rho, T, Y_e)=F+TS$ : Internal Energy





NS matter has three degrees of freedom [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Usually parametrized in terms of baryon number density $n_B$, temperature $T$, and electron fraction $Y_e$.  [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Assumes macroscopic charge neutrality (since astrophysical objects are assumed to carry negligible net charge) [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - Assumes NS matter is highly conductive.  [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)


The variables $n_B$ and $Y_e$ are equivalent to the thermodynamic state variables V (volume) and particle numbers $N_i$ for protons and neutrons. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

The behavior of matter is completely described by a single thermodynamic potential, meaning a scalar function of a particular set of state variables. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

There are different but completely equivalent thermodynamic potentials, each based on a different set of state variables. When using state variables (V, T, Ni), the corresponding potential is the Helmholtz free energy F(V, T, Ni). [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)

It should be noted that one cannot chose the various EOS functions independently. The existence of a thermodynamic potential implies thermodynamic consistency constraints. For example, -∂P/∂T = ∂S/∂V = ∂ 2F/∂T ∂V . If those constraints are violated, an EOS is physically invalid. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)








#### Barotropic EOS
 - Pressure and energy density can be expressed as functions $P(\rho)$ and $E(\rho)$ of the mass density alone. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - employing a barotropic EOS means that two of the matter degrees of freedom are restricted somehow. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - where thermal effects can be neglected and one can set $T = 0$ for all practical purposes.  [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - model equilibrium models. For those, the electron fraction becomes a function of density because weak processes drive the matter towards β-equilibrium. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - For perturbed NS, β-equilibrium is maintained if the perturbation timescale is much longer than the intrinsic timescales of weak processes. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
**Equation of State:**
$$\begin{align}
\dfrac{\text{d}E}{\text{d}\rho}&=h & \dfrac{\text{d}\epsilon}{\text{d}\rho}&=\dfrac{P}{\rho^2} & \dfrac{\text{d}h}{\text{d}P}&=\dfrac{1}{\rho}\\
\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align}
c_s^2&=\dfrac{\text{d}P}{\text{d}E}=\dfrac{1}{h}\dfrac{\text{d}P}{\text{d}\rho}\\
0&\le c_s^2 < 1
\end{align}$$
Where $c_s$ is the adiabatic speed of sound, which for isentropic barotropic has that equiv.
