### Software Stuff
 - Despite the astrophysical importance of computing NS properties, the available software infrastructure is very limited. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - This task is unnecessarily difficult because relevant formulas are scattered throughout the literature and publicly available software tools are far from being complete and easy to use. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - computing NS properties as part of the library RePrimAnd. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
 - RePrimAnd was developed to support general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations [23]. [2404.11346](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11346)
