I believe that prime numbers have a deep connection to information theory when it comes to minimal representations that allow us to find a set of numbers that minimizes the information required to represent natural numbers.

Showing minimality of the prime numbers as a multiplication basis for the natural numbers > 2:
**Note:** $S_n=\left\{i|2\le i\le n, i\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ where $2\ge n\in\mathbb{Z}$.


### Consequences of the space
We've shown that $\text{span}(B_{V})=\mathbb{Z^+}\backslash\{0\}$.
$$2_b=\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\\\vdots\end{bmatrix},3_b=\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0\\\vdots\end{bmatrix},5_b=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\\\vdots\end{bmatrix},\dots$$
Properties:
$|u|=$
$u+v=|u||v|$
