### Playfair Cipher
Take string of the alphabet, take the keyword and remove duplicate letters, and combine I and J into a singular spot. Take the keyword as the beginning of the key, and then put the rest of the alphabet that wasn't already used in alphabetical order.
Arrange this in a left-to-right table, splitting at every 5 letters.

Split your plaintext into digraphs. If the digraphs are repeated letters, insert an "x" in between the letters.
Add an "x" if the plaintext is an odd number of characters.

Case 1: Both letters are in the same row of the 5x5 grid.
Replace each letter with the letter to its right on the table.

Case 2: Both letters are in the same column of the 5x5 grid.
Replace each letter with the letter below it on the table.

Case 3: Neither the above:
Form a rectangle out of the corners of the letters, and replace the letter with the one that's in the same row.
