### Bezout's Lemma
Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Then $\gcd(a,b)$ is the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form $ma+bn$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers.

### Chinese Remainder Theorem
Given a set of equations for $x\equiv a_i\mod n_i$, if all of $n_i$ are coprime with each other, there will be a solution to the set of equations.

### Euler Totient Function
The function $\phi(n)=$ # of positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.
$$\begin{align}
\phi(1)&=1 & \phi(4)&=2 & \phi(5)&=4 & \phi(p)&=p-1
\end{align}$$
