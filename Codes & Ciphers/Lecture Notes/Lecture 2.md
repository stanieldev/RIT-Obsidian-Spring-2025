### Shift Cipher
Key: Number to shift the letters over by.
Permutation Count: $26$.
#### Example Exercise
You intercept the following Cipher Text:
`HWDUYTLWFUMD NX UWJYYD HTTQ`
You think the algorithm is a Shift Cipher:
 - Spaces between letters give information.
 - Repeated characters.
 - Would be breakable by letter frequency of target language.
The true Plain Text was:
`cryptography is pretty cool`
### Substitution Cipher
Key: The mapping of `a-z` to a sequence of letters.
Permutation Count $\approx26!$
