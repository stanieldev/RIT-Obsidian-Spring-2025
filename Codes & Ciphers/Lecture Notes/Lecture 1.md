### Caesar Cipher
Shifting each letter by $3$ to the right to encrypt the message.
### Shift Cipher
Shifting each letter by $N$ over to encrypt the message.
### Algorithms and Keys
Every crypto-system has an algorithm and a key.
Together, they specify a particular encryption (and decryption) process.
### Kerchoff's Principle
A good system should be secure even if an adversary knows the algorithm.
The encryption should rely on the key for its security.
### Cryptology
The study of data communications and data storage in a secure form.
