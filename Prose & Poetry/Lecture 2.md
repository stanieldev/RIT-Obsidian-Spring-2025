### Warm-Up Exercise
*Describe your dorm room / main room*:
 - It is white walls with a brown vinyl flooring like wood.
 - There is a singular light in the middle.
 - There is a smoke detector on the southern wall.
 - My heat vent is blocked with a piece of paper above my door.
 - I have a table beside my bed with my medication, tissues, and a can of hard cider.
 - At the end of my bed is a TV.
 - My bed is blue checkerboard pattern for the comforter.
 - I have a weighted blanked that is also blue.
 - Under my bed is guitar case and 2 baskets for laundry.
 - My computer is next to my bed on the other side as the table.
 - My desk is parallel with my headboard next to my desktop.
 - I have a 15.6" monitor in the middle of my desk.
 - My desk has a bunch of office supplies on top (list if wanted)
 - I have my homework papers on the left of the top of my desk.
 - My office chair is inside my desk.
 - To the right of my desk is the closet door.
 - Inside the closet is a bunch of free boxes, my ice skates in a bag, a suitcase with my raspberry pi materials, and a smaller suitcase that holds all the papers from everything I've worked on since I got to RIT.
 - Behind my office chair is my door, but it's to the left when sitting.
 - It is a smaller room but not a tiny room.
 - The window is sealed to avoid cold coming in and making it cold.
 - Under my TV is a dresser
 - The dresser has my TV, centered in the middle, and a picture of my family and one of my pair of grandparents to either side.
 - I have my passport, wallet, and keys on the right hand side in front of the TV on it's stand.
#### Prose Form
Walking into my room is the feel of cold air due to the piece of paper that blocks the vent just above the doorway. The open door leads to the dresser, with a 50" TV resting upon it, as well as many smaller trinkets I keep that decorate the bottom of the TV stand. Within the dresser is all my clothing, barring the closet's dress clothing, and it is a tall wooden box with 4 large drawers and 2 smaller drawers on top. It is a dark brown stained wood. Similarly, the bedside table is in the opposite corner to the door, and contains the medicine and tissues I may need. Apparently, my bed awaits to hide the bedside table from the door, and is where I rest. Parallel to the headboard, the large desk with a shelf on top provides storage for my office equipment, and below is my monitor and laptop ready to do schoolwork. My office chair rests under the desk, but to its left from front, the closet is there to hide my boxes and older items. And, finally, the door leads to my dress clothing for formal attire wears, which returns the circling back to the door of which we entered. The room is white, and the floor a brown vinyl. This is where I live.
#### A story that takes place there
It was an early morning: one I had dreaded. It is 8am, and I must make myself awake to be ready for classes. I feel a massive inertia to get out of bed, wanting to just keep sleeping or watching funny videos on my phone. But I must get up, for it is the day where I am introduced to my new therapist. I make my way to the bathroom to brush my teeth and such, then return to my bed. I really want to just stay asleep. Instead, I choose to go to my desk where I know I usually work. I join the call and slowly start to wake up. We talk about me a lot, especially with how I cope with things. I've learned a lot to make sure that I'm alright, and know how to handle myself when I'm overwhelmed. I talk about what ails me, and we decide a course of action for further sessions. I leave the call after making our next appointment, and I stay awake only just debate politics in an RIT server, which was a mistake. Oh well, I'll just go to class now. I'll probably write about this since I'm way too tired after taking my meds.
