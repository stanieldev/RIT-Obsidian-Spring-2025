The time of the day to eat. I hunger for something of the starch variety, however I am out of the typical household good. I cannot consume bread, for that causes awful stomach issues, nor potatoes since it's been long since I've last visited the grocer. Given my current predicament, I must go to my old beloved: rice. Rice from the far aways lands of Walmart, a large bag of dense fiber and nutrients. While I have meat and spices, having those would be not as fulfilling as a seasoned bowl of rice with protein. I make my way over, pour some into the mixing bowl with water, as to remove the outward starch on the surface. Then into the instant pot is goes, for it can handle my rice with care without error. Behold, my bowl of rice: fresh and ready for consumption.
