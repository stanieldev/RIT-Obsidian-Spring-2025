### Warm-Up Exercise
The cold air creeps up the walls as the door shutters with the trembling whispers of the night.  "Just one more hour," as the life fades from his frigid body.  His mind, shattered, hoping for the return of his loved one.  Within minutes, his body fills with the heat of a thousand suns, feeling almost euphoric.  In his haze, he gets up from his ragged cot, walking toward the doorway.  Any other man would have quit, but he was stronger, for he had seen a silhouette in the window;  she had returned. Pressing his face against the window, an effort to get closer to his beloved, the cold and relentless winter starts to break upon his face.  Cold that he had so recently broken, but returning once again.  The snap of temperature shocked his senses: to realize that she was not there.  With one final breath, he crumbles to the floor, pleading to his God that she may return.
