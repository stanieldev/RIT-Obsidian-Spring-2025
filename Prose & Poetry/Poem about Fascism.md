Take a guy who is in a world where fascists start to take over.

It starts with a certain minority
"I'm not them, but I should help"

Then another
"I have to protect my own family. it was your responsibly for your own"

Then another
"why should I help you. They said you were doing XYZ"

Then your mother for an ex-post facto crime
"I have to protect the rest. Besides, you should have known"
(this was after it was super drilled in that abortion is wrong)

Then one by one the rest of your family

In the end, it is just you. The officer comes to take you away.
You ask why, they say for something you hadn't done.
But you agree, and believe you're a bad person and should be punished.

They take you and execute you. No one is left.




Emphasis originally on tradition
On what is right early

Later about what the media tells
What the schools tell

Then what the government says directly
and what authority says

Then eventually, just you.
