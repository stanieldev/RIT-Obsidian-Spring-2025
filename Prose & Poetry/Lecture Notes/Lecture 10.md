### Schedule
**Reading due:**
> “Writing the Short-Short Story” pages 102-130 & “The Lede” & Carver’s “Popular Mechanics” & Sherman Alexie’s “What You Pawn I Will Redeem” & Connell’s “The Most Dangerous Game” & one of the Edgar Allan Poe stories & Carmen Maria Machado’s “Real Women Have Bodies” (all are posted in myCourses → Content → Required Readings, etc.) PLUS posted documents about Showing vs. telling/direct vs. indirect characterization, etc.  

**Writing due by regular class time:** 
> Character sketch: an extensive (bulleted) list or a prose exploration of one character you would like to explore and potentially use in a short-short fiction piece; the more details and backstory the richer your character can become (see examples) AND a Dialogue (of at least 20 lines / 10 exchanges—add other elements if necessary): ideally, between the character of your sketch and someone else; make realistic but not too realistic (don’t forget: normal speech does not play well on the page); SEE the examples!

**Also:**
> Post in myCourses by FRIDAY 2/14 at 11:59pm: Discuss at least three stories (from the Carver, Alexie, Connell, Poe and Machado). Each will have its own discussion forum. What is expected is one original post and at least one comment in response to someone else’s post—for at least three different stories. More than three is welcome. I will post initial participation grades after this.
