### Schedule
**Reading due:**
> “Writing the Short-Short Story” pages 102-130 & “The Lede” & Carver’s “Popular Mechanics” & Sherman Alexie’s “What You Pawn I Will Redeem” & Connell’s “The Most Dangerous Game” & one of the Edgar Allan Poe stories & Carmen Maria Machado’s “Real Women Have Bodies” (all are posted in myCourses → Content → Required Readings, etc.) PLUS posted documents about Showing vs. telling/direct vs. indirect characterization, etc.  

**Writing due by regular class time:** 
> Character sketch: an extensive (bulleted) list or a prose exploration of one character you would like to explore and potentially use in a short-short fiction piece; the more details and backstory the richer your character can become (see examples) AND a Dialogue (of at least 20 lines / 10 exchanges—add other elements if necessary): ideally, between the character of your sketch and someone else; make realistic but not too realistic (don’t forget: normal speech does not play well on the page); SEE the examples!
