### Warm-Up Exercise
"This is how you..." (include the voice of the other person and superstition)

This is how you act with people.
This is how you talk to people.
Don't be saying anything provocative.

"But I..."

This is how you hide your smarts.
This is how you show respect.
Don't be saying you know better.

"I'm not trying to be..."

This is how you dumb yourself down.
This is how you make others feel special.
Don't be trying to stand out.

"Why can't I..."

This is how you let others win.
This is how you bring yourself down.
Don't be saying you're not stupid.

"But I'm not..."

This is how you bend the truth.
This is how you hide from others.
Don't be pitying those above you.

"That's awful..."

Be the way that savant people like you should act.
Be the way that retarded people like you should act.
Don't be the best of both, be the lesser.

"ENOUGH."


### Memoir Review
I think she connected the 3 different passages very well, and I think her first was the best of them.
They felt very relatable and grounded, and I could envision the situation since my older sister went through things similar in her younger years.

### What I Will Revise
I want to improve clarity in my passages, and perhaps making it more clear that the connection is about my family and people in my family. (My genetics, My Mother, My Dog Snoopy).
