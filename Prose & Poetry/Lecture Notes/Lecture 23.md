### Warm-Up Exercise
#### To Alaska
Missing the days of sun through the pines.
Missing the ravens outside my window.
To where wild things are known.
My heart turns to Alaska.

I wish for the endless days and nights.
The winter's grays and summer's flights.
To nature's endless beauty.
My heart turns to Alaska.

Long has it been to see her waters,
Her greatest mountains, her river's valleys.
To freedom on the run.
My heart turns to Alaska.

I can here her spirit calling me.
I cannot ignore her any longer.
To the land that is my home.
My heart turns to Alaska.

The land where I belong.
