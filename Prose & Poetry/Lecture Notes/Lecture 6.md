### Warm-Up Exercise (Changing rhymes of a song)
The world is the whisper of humans of Earth
The world is the hand of our father, on high
The world watches over our struggles and pleasures
The world is the planet who first learned to thrive

The world is the nature of bad and good tidings
Weaver of darkness, singer of songs
The world gives the rain (yes), and builds us a rainbow
The world is the maker who brought the first dawn

The world is a twister of anger and mourning  
The world brings the sanctum of the human race
The world is the racer and the wild stallion running
And the sweet taste of love on a cold winter's day

The world knows the songs of cities and canyons
Thunder of mountains, the roar of the sea
The world is the taker and giver of mornings
The world is the symbol of all that is "we"

So welcome the world and the wisdom she offers
Follow her summons when she calls again
In your heart and your spirit let the people surround you
Lift up your voice then and sing with the world

### Poem 1
"After returning from work, you walk into your house and notice an item that wasn’t there when you left in the morning. What room were you in, what was the item and how did it get there?"

I wake in sweat
11am, late for class
I run to the bus stop
Luck, is it there
I arrive winded
Teacher, not there

I walk home sad
Late, I must have been
But on my bed I saw
Note: It is Sunday


### Poem 2
“When did your hair turn white?”  
“A long time ago. When I was young.”  
“Why?”

My family filled with late agers.
All look young, act young, hair young.

Then is my father, and his father,
and his father, and his father before him.

I am the son of my father?
Perhaps I stand a chance?

No, says genetics,
As I look to the mirror, a glance.
