### Warm-Up Exercise
Something about Snow or Santa Claus.
#### Alaskan Snows
Winter breeze and chilly skies,
Cloudy days, quite divine.
Softly trickle upon the ground,
Walking makes a joyful sound.
If it be that snow shall fall,
Perhaps it shan't that way at all?
Snow is rain mixed with cold,
for the efforts of weather take it's toll.

What is War?


### Brand New Poem
#### War
*Inspired by “The Box” by Lascelles Abercrombie*

War is about needless sacrifice.
War is about revenge and hatred.
War is about control and power.
War is about anger and enslavement.
War is not about us, nor them.

People do not fight wars, soldiers do.
Soldiers are a number; their skill, a statistic.
People are the expected victims of war.
Soldiers are lives lost, enslaved by the elites.
But what are they fighting for?

War is not about right and wrong.
War is not about unity, nor harmony.
War is not about peace, nor empathy.
War is not about salvation, nor utopia.
War is the language of bitter men.

When one asks why we have war:
"Business as usual," say the elite.
But when we are killing children,
and women, and men, and civilians, and innocents...
What are we fighting for?
