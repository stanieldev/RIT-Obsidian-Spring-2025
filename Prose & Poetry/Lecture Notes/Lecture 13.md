### Warm-Up Exercise
Before and after of a man in a pool who has a suit.

He lay in the still water, unmoving, basking in the late haze of the sunset. While there are clouds over head, they are static. Laid to rest, left with his suit that he once wore so proudly, but above him stands a masked man of great height. "May you lay to rest in this water to drown in the river Styx."
