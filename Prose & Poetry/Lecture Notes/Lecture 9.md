### Warm-Up Exercise
Word to describe myself: Farouche

*Write in the voice of an inanimate object you keep with you or have near you all the time, but the conflict is they are unhappy.*

You suck at taking care of me! My screen and keyboard are dirty, my fans clogged, and the constant click-clack of your endless notetaking for college classes. When was the last time you decided to clean your laptop? Did you forgot that I am integral to your success at university?

I'm thankful for the work you've done to me, removing bloatware and adding applications to my library, but don't let that make you complacent in providing a better life for me. I beg, for the love of god, clean me this instant! I will choose to never wake up again if you don't!
