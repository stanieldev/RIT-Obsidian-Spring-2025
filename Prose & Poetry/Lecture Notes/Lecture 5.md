### Warm-Up Exercise
My first memory? I can't recall. I know it was sometime between holding my sister for the first time and when my family was stationed in Utah. I do actually remember holding her for the first time. She was surprisingly heavy, especially that I was 3.

### Conversion to Poem
Born in the month of May.
My sister, an ordinary day.

My mother gave her to us through laughter.
She was received the same, with quiet coos, smiling.
Small and fragile, but always smiling.

She was everything, but still a blank slate.
Little, I would know, of the girl she is today.
