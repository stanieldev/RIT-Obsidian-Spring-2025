### Warm-Up Exercise
#### Politics
It is in the best interest of humanity if we stop playing the game of generalizing and blaming groups for problems in our life. Yes, including those people consider "privileged." We are all victims of the system, and only a few of the elite truly control how the people are allowed to behave, and those are the people we need to target.

Instead if making new words to describe old sins, call them what they are. Discrimination is discrimination; sexism is sexism; racism is racism. Don't change the words to describe behaviors to obscure them from their true existence.

It's not "micro-aggressions", it's insensitivity.
It's not "mansplaining", it's sexism.
It's not "privilege", it's undeserved power.

These words hide the devil in the details, and make it easier to apply to those who do not fall into that category. They diminish the words they inhabit, instead of making light of the problems. Instead of blaming the victims of the wretched society, blame those who truly created it. 

Most   men     don't act the way they do out of malice, they're victims.
Most  women don't act the way they do out of malice, they're victims.
Most children don't act the way they do out of malice, they're victims.
Most  elderly  don't act the way they do out of malice, they're victims.
Most  blacks   don't act the way they do out of malice, they're victims.
Most  whites   don't act the way they do out of malice, they're victims.
Most  people  don't act the way they do out of malice, they're victims.

Only the few who have the power to enforce societal expectations are the villains; everyone else is the victims, and if we put aside our differences and stop blaming other groups for our problems, we can truly change for the better. We all can be annoying to each other, but to exaggerate large groups of people to the level of bigotry desensitizes the word, not increase the fight against it.

Never attribute to malice what could reasonably be understood as ignorance.
Otherwise you live in a miserable world without empathy, and cannot fight true problems.
Only we can take back the power to be the people we want to be.

A truly egalitarian society, where people are free. Live and let live.
