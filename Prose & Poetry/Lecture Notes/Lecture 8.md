### Schedule
**Reading due:**
> F. Prose on Close Reading (posted in myCourses -> Content -> Required Readings, etc.) AND “Verbal Fillers” & “Writing the Short-Short Story” pages 102-152 (stop after “Writing Convincing Dialogue”)

**Writing due:** 
> Character sketch: an extensive (bulleted) list or a prose exploration of one character you would like to explore and potentially use in a short-short fiction piece; the more details and backstory the richer your character can become (see examples) AND a Dialogue (of at least 20 lines / 10 exchanges): ideally, between the character of your sketch and someone else; make realistic but not too realistic (don’t forget: normal speech does not play well on the page); SEE the examples!

### Warm-Up Exercise
Find phrases that work as the start of an Anaphora:
"If I had more time..."
"Perhaps Love..." (Inspired by John Denver / Plácido Domingo)
"It's about time..." (Inspired by John Denver)
"When I was a child..."
"If I were leader..."
"When my parents die..."
"The time where I..."
"I had a vision..."  (Inspired by Eagles and Horses Chorus)
"I dreamed..."

#### Concept
"The time where I... failures"
"The time where I... successes"
"The time where I realized I am human"
**aggressive snapping sounds**

#### War as Anaphora Style
War is about needless sacrifice.
War is about revenge and hatred.
War is about control and power.
War is about anger and enslavement.

War is the language of bitter men.

War is not about right and wrong.
War is not about unity, nor harmony.
War is not about peace, nor empathy.
War is not about salvation, nor utopia.

War is not the us, nor the them.

#### Time Makes Us Human
The time where I fell down my stairs.
The time where I hurt someone I love.
The time where I left my friends behind.
The time where I gave up on romance.

The time where I modeled new discoveries.
The time where I helped students in need.
The time where I learned to effectively socialize.
The time where I gave hope to everyone.

The time where I realized I am human.

### How I guessed it was formatted
All the grass
dies
in front of us.

The fire
again
flares out.

The night 
such a 
large place. 

Stars, the points,
but like places
no depth, 

I see
a flat - a plain 
as if

the desert
were showing
smaller places.
