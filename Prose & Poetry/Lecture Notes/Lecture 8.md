### Schedule
**Reading due:**
> F. Prose on Close Reading (posted in myCourses -> Content -> Required Readings, etc.) AND “Verbal Fillers” & “Writing the Short-Short Story” pages 102-152 (stop after “Writing Convincing Dialogue”)

**Writing due:** 
> Character sketch: an extensive (bulleted) list or a prose exploration of one character you would like to explore and potentially use in a short-short fiction piece; the more details and backstory the richer your character can become (see examples) AND a Dialogue (of at least 20 lines / 10 exchanges): ideally, between the character of your sketch and someone else; make realistic but not too realistic (don’t forget: normal speech does not play well on the page); SEE the examples!
