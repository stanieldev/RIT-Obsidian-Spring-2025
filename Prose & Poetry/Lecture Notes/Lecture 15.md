#### My Traits
My family has quite a large variance in traits. Despite my mother having dark eyes and dark hair, all of her children have light eyes and light hair, just like my father. It is quite comedic at times, especially when I annoy mom enough that she'll turn to my dad and say "your son..." We all were born of her, there's no doubt of that, but regardless we seem to only share in the most subtle of traits. My older sister looks very much like my dad's mother, and my younger sister like my mother's mother. As for me, I look like a hybrid between my dad and my maternal uncle, where I am definitely French Canadian with a nose as large as father's.

#### My Mother's Worries / Gravity
When I was young, I had a relationship with gravity like no other. I would constantly fall down, drop down, and go places I was never supposed to. When I was first starting to crawl, I decided it would be fun to try going down the stairs. I was resilient, but my mother freaked out. Despite being uninjured, she was very worried for me. As I got older, I loved moving fast when the snow came that year. Gravity, later as gravitational potential energy, is how I loved to move fast. I always scared mom though, especially times that I would roll out and down the mountain when my sled got caught on the ground. Gravity always keeps me grounded, especially when I'm high up. Regardless, I love jumping off tall walls onto the grass. I love climbing trees, even the ones where I break the branch and fall 12 feet. Mama always said to be careful, but I always give her a reason to worry it seems. I later studied physics, and gravity was my main attraction. At least this time it will be pen and paper, not falling out of trees, falling down stairs, sledding at fast speeds, and any other nonsense my young brain cooked up. Mom worries less now.

#### My Snoopy
How she was quite a pleasure. Snoopy, the most anxious beagle I think I've ever met; a natural disaster in the making, she was hard to manage. Despite the countless child-locks on the trash, she'd always find a way to paw her way in, eating whatever was inside. Her stomach was of steel, eating anything and everything. She's eaten chocolate, two bars in fact, but no such consequences. She's eaten half of my $50 bill, but luckily I had 51% to be able to be able to get my finances back from the bank. She's eaten rocks, pennies, countless paper products, anything edible, and many not. Except, she was special. She wouldn't eat lettuce. She would eat all adjacent families, and literally everything else you gave her, but she would refuse to eat lettuce. She was my best friend growing up, and I loved her to death. The only thing able to kill her was the lymphatic cancer. Even when we felt that we needed to put her down, they gave her the expected dose to put her to sleep. I was ready to say good bye, but she decided to add one more bit of comedy in her not being normal as ever. She required a second dosage, leaving us waiting for the doctor to come back with another needle. Needless to say, I will miss her forever, and hope to see her at the pearly gates when I arrive.
