### Warm-Up Exercise

The bicker between a scientist and literary scholar, happily merged in wedlock.
I think it would be interesting to make it so you don't actually know who's who.
 - Both of them reference literature and science, since they've been together.
 - They're modeled after my parents. I love them so much.


Abraham: Finished?
Marie: Never finished.
Abraham (under breath): Not what you said yesterday.
Marie: I beg your pardon?
Abraham: I've been finished writing for 3 days and all I hear from you is complaint!
         So tell me, how are you *never* finished?
Marie: My work must keep going. How else am I to keep my status?
Abraham: What status?
*Marie glares at Abraham*
Marie (small smile): Rude


Marie: Who was it who said "till death do us part"?
Abraham: Well, I'm not sure.
Marie: Me, it was me. At our *wedding??*
Abraham: No no, too eloquent. Not enough lovey-dovey.
Marie: Oh shut up.
Abraham: Still lucky I got you. You definitely married down.
Marie: Hardly. You keep up with me.
Abraham: No no, I keep you on your toes.
         Nary a day goes by I don't actively annoy you.
Marie: *How romantic.*


Abraham: Care for a dance, young lady?
Marie: Since when have you been a gentleman?
Abraham: Longer than you have.
*Marie rolls her eyes with a smile.*
Abraham: ...so about your book.
Marie: Enough about work, I'd like to enjoy myself.
Abraham: Despite slaving away 13 hours a day?
		 Hard to believe you don't enjoy it.
Marie: Not as much as this.
*Abraham lets out a goofy smile.*
Abraham: Oh right, I forgot. I can't dance.
Marie: Oh shut up. <3
