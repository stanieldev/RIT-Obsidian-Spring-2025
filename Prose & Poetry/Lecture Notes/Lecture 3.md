How does/did your family cook rice?
 - Tell a story / Write an essay
 - (or) Write a poem

The time of the day to eat. I hunger for something of the starch variety, however I am out of the typical household good. I cannot consume bread, for that causes awful stomach issues, nor potatoes since it's been long since I've last visited the grocer. Given my current predicament, I must go to my old beloved: rice. Rice from the far aways lands of Walmart, a large bag of dense fiber and nutrients. While I have meat and spices, having those would be not as fulfilling as a seasoned bowl of rice with protein. I make my way over, pour some into the mixing bowl with water, as to remove the outward starch on the surface. Then into the instant pot is goes, for it can handle my rice with care without error. Behold, my bowl of rice: fresh and ready for consumption.

### In-Class Stuff
We talked about the creative writing process, as well as topics of revision.

### A Letter to Fear (or Courage)
Dear Fear,

Thank you for looking out for me over my life, keeping me safe, and allowing me to see another day over and over. Your methods, at time, are questionable, but I found that your importance cannot be understates. I do wish that it were more of a cooperative effort between you and I, instead of a wrestling match to have you relinquish control over, but I can understand that *fear* of non-controllability that stems from a secondary agent.

In the future, I expect you to do the work you do, and that I shall help guide the path for our progression so that your work isn't as required as it has been in the past. Regardless, you've been an immense help to me and my survival, knowing that the survival of one is the survival of all.

Thank you for your effort,
C. Logic
