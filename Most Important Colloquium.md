Title: Following Faraday's Hint in the Search for Quantum Gravity.
### Getting Started
Physics benefits are usually on the order of decades to centuries.
He was inspired by Michael Faraday, and his textbook had many pictures.
You can describe things better with images and visuals.
Narrative is what people latch onto. Make something memorable.

### Faraday
He was a very good experimentalist. Very creative.
He noticed a pattern in current-carrying wires and compasses.
"Invisible" lines of force interact like a flag in the wind.
The physics he invented was revolutionary.
The views of Newton was dominant during the time.
Faraday who added onto Newton, there are these "fields" (new physics).
He wasn't trained in mathematics, but was an amazing experimentalist.
Faraday's "Lines of Force" led to Maxwell's Equations.

### Picture of the Photon
The photon was recently pictured, published in Nov 2024.
It looks stellated, not just a ball.
From circular polarized light, you can rewrite as "starfish" and "rings."
Equations visualizing the universe can make predictions very early.

### Albert Einstein
Principle of Equivalence doesn't really have an existence in String Theory.
Gravitational Gauge Covariant Derivative
$$\nabla_a\equiv_a^m\partial_m+\dfrac{1}{2}\omega_{ac}^d\mathcal{M}_d^c$$
This was Einstein mathematically deriving gravity as curvature.

### Gravity Waves
Gravitational waves can also be polarized (theorized, currently experimenting).


### Random Ideas I thought of
Temperature of the free energy in local fields lead to higher perturbations.
Perhaps a symmetry break is more of a critical phase transition of 2 different kinds of "oscillation resonances." Think of it akin to the logistic curve having a fork in Chaos Theory.

All I see in this table is that there's an extra "bit" of information in SUSY.

Connection between equations and information states as graph theory.
Network Theory in Statistical Mechanics finds mean properties and distributions.
