Interesting idea I'm currently working on:

Take the wavefunction and energy in infinite potential well:
$$\begin{align}
\psi(x)&=\sqrt{\dfrac{2}{a}}\sin\left(\dfrac{n\pi}{a}x\right), & E_n&=\dfrac{\hbar^2\pi^2}{2ma^2}n^2
\end{align}$$
Using the definition of Entropy from probabilities, we can write it as:
$$\begin{align}
S(\psi)/k&=\int\braket{\psi|\psi}\ln\braket{\psi|\psi}\\
\end{align}$$
For the case of the particle in an infinite potential well, it surprisingly is the same value for every state parametrized by $n$ (principle quantum number). It doesn't matter what mass or box size until $a<2$, then it started making nonsense.


When I plug in the QHO solution, the difference in entropy between states is unchanging upon changing mass and angular frequency.
